    <b><li>Killers Of The Flower Moon-2023 (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5537002/?ref_=adv_li_tt">IMBD Rating: 9.3</a>)</li></b><br />

    <br /><ul><li>Anna Burkhart was killed in May, and Grann uses the symbol of the flower-killing moon to represent what happened to the Osage at the hands of whites: like the smaller flowers, their resources are stolen and they die.</li></ul><br />
    <b><li>The Dark Night-2008 (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=adv_li_tt">IMBD Rating: 9.0</a>)</li></b><br />
    <img src="../assets/images/the_dark_night.jpg" height="200" alt="the_dark_night"><br />
    <br /><ul><li>The film is loaded with intense action, from bombs and bullets to martial-arts fighting and hand-to-hand combat. In addition to the hard-hitting action, expect some drinking and a bit of sexuality. And The Joker's nightmarish appearance has the potential to frighten viewers of all ages.</li></ul><br />
    <b><li>Inception-2010 (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=adv_li_tt">IMBD Rating: 8.8</a>)</li></b><br />
    <img src="../assets/images/inception.jpg" height="200" alt="inception"><br />
    <br /><ul><li>The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased, as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious</li></ul><br />
    <b><li>The Batman-2022 (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/?ref_=adv_li_tt">IMBD Rating: 7.8</a>)</li></b><br />
    <img src="../assets/images/the_batman.jpg" height="200" alt="the_batman"><br />
    <br /><ul><li>Another reason The Batman's plot is great is that it balances action and drama perfectly. While there are plenty of high-octane fight scenes and thrilling action sequences, the story also takes the time to delve into its characters' emotional and psychological struggles.</li></ul><br />
    <b><li>John Wick-2014 (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ref_=adv_li_tt">IMBD Rating: 7.4</a>)</li></b><br />
    <img src="../assets/images/john_wick.jpg" height="200" alt="john_wick"><br />
